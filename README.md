## Our Aim:
1. To find situations where turn of dialog can occur based on a set of defined rules for a pair of dialog acts  
2. When turn of dialog occurs, map speaker id to it, if not obvious keep it as unknown
3. Recognize emotion from the entire dialog sequence in each movie being tested and predict

## Steps involved in Natural Language Processing:
1. Sentence Segmentation
2. Word Tokenization
3. Predicting Parts of Speech for Each Token
4. Text Lemmatization 
5. Identifying and Removing Stop words
6. Dependency Parsing
7. Finding Noun Phrases
8. Named Entity Recognition 
9. Coreference Resolution (resolving ambiguity with usage of pronouns)
